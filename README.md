# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project explores the **Boston Housing dataset** to predict housing prices using different machine learning models.  
I compared multiple regression models and tuned hyperparameters to find the best-performing one.

---

## 📊 Models Tested
- Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet  
- Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- SVR, Logistic Regression (baseline), Neural Network (MLP)

---

## 🔎 Results & Insights
- **Random Forest** performed best with R² ≈ **0.85** and lowest MSE.  
- Gradient Boosting also gave strong results.  
- Simpler models like Linear/Ridge/Lasso underperformed.  
- SVR and Neural Network were not suitable for this dataset.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Scikit-learn (Regression models, evaluation metrics)  
- Kaggle (Notebook environment)
